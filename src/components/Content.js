          <div className="hea2 fs-5 p-2">
            The International Conference on Separation and Purification Technologies (ICSPT) aims at highlighting recent scientific developments in the area of separation and purification techniques and to bring together researchers working in these areas. The primary focus of the conference will be on developments applicable in the following industries:
    <ul>
              <li>Pharmaceutical Industry</li>
              <li>Agrochemical Industry</li>
              <li>Food Industry</li>
            </ul>
            The conference will provide a platform to bring together academicians, industrialists, and entrepreneurs working in the above areas to share their knowledge. The conference will also witness a pre-conference workshop and an agro-processing startup meet. The workshop will focus on advanced research methodologies and analytical tools used in separation and purification processes.

          <div className=" hea2 p-2 fs-5">
            The workshop will focus on the research and analytical techniques utilized in downstream separation processes. The sessions will be handled by experts from academic and industrial organizations. A hands-on session on the application of Design of Experiments (DoE), preparation of research proposals, and commercialization of research would be useful for all research scholars, beyond the theme of the conference. The details of the session topics and speakers will be updated shortly on the website.
            The number of seats for the pre-conference workshop would be limited and the registrations will be approved on a first-cum-first-serve basis.

          Startups play a major role in the translation of research for the benefit of the general public. The startup ecosystem is also an overlooked career opportunity for research scholars in India. Hosting a startup session along with the technical conference aims at bridging the gap between research and startups. While startups can benefit from recent technological developments, researchers can secure an opportunity to work closely on translating their knowledge base for marketable outputs.
